TOPSIS Package
TOPSIS is a multi-criteria decision-making method (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution). It ranks and selects the best choice for a set of alternatives based on several criteria.
Python implementation of this method is done in TOPSIS package. It accepts a decision matrix (input file) along with criteria, weights, and impacts (+ for benefit, – for cost). It normalizes the information, determines the greatest and the least effective regards, generates scores, and orders the options. And last but not least, the output (score and ranks) is written to the output file.
It is helpful for making decisions in several fields like business, engineering, and project management. It reduces the complexity of carrying out TOPSIS, allowing for easy writing of programmatic implementations for the same.

Features of TOPSIS:

Multi-criteria decision-making:

This property of TOPSIS makes it suitable for complex decision making situations where several alternatives have to be evaluated against multiple criteria.

Rank-Based Output:

It orders alternatives from best to worst, which helps to make clear the appropriate choice.

Simple Calculation Process:

Consists of simple steps such as normalization, scoring, and distance metrics making it easy to implement.

Realistic Evaluation:

Puts the optimal best (greatest benefit) or optimal worse (least cost) scenario up side by side for comparison.

Weighing and Impacts with Customization:

About the criteria, users can place the importance (weights) of the criteria and can define whether they are the solution (+) or cost (-).



To install the package, use the following command:
pip install topsis_package
